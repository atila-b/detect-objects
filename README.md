# detect-objects

Image Processing (COMP0432) project. We created a script that detects objects in PBM images and also tells apart objects that have holes in them.

- `detect-objects.py` is the object detecting script.

This script take an image as a command line argument. You'll need Python 3+ installed.

```
$ python detect-objects.py images/objects_1.pbm
```

To visualizate the .bmp images you should use a image editor software as GIMP
